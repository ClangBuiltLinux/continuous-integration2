[![Check clang version](https://github.com/clangbuiltlinux/continuous-integration2/actions/workflows/clang-version.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/clangbuiltlinux/continuous-integration2/actions/workflows/clang-version.yml)


Testing using [TuxSuite](https://gitlab.com/Linaro/tuxsuite) to build the Linux
kernel with LLVM under CI.

All test parameters are encoded in `generator.yml`; new trees, architectures,
configs, etc. should be added there.

### Usage

The tuxsuite and github actions workflow configs should be updated when
`generator.yml` changes. Ex.
```sh
$ BRANCH=next
$ ./generate_tuxsuite.py $BRANCH
$ ./generate_workflow.py $BRANCH
```

The `generate.py` script will run this for you based on the trees that are fed
to it. Ex.

```
# Generate just next and mainline TuxSuite and GitHub Action workflows
$ ./generate.py next mainline

# Regenerate all of the current TuxSuite and GitHub Action workflows
$ ./generate.py
```

The CI the child workflows run can be rerun locally via:
```sh
$ ARCH=arm CONFIG=defconfig LLVM_VERSION=[12|11] [BOOT=0] [INSTALL_DEPS=1] \
  ./check_logs.py
```

Where `ARCH` and `CONFIG` are canonical names from the Linux kernel sources,
but should be listed in `generator.yml`.  `LLVM_VERSION` is which version of
LLVM to test.  `BOOT=0` can be specified to skip the boot test (for instance,
when boot failure is expected). `INSTALL_DEPS=1` can be specified to install
the child workflow dependcies (mostly QEMU) which the github actions workers
need to do.

Requires that a
[TuxSuite secret token](https://gitlab.com/Linaro/tuxsuite#setup-config) is
configured.
