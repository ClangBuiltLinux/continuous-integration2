[![Check clang version](https://github.com/clangbuiltlinux/continuous-integration2/actions/workflows/clang-version.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/clangbuiltlinux/continuous-integration2/actions/workflows/clang-version.yml)

Testing using [TuxSuite](https://gitlab.com/Linaro/tuxsuite) to build the Linux kernel with LLVM under CI.

All test parameters are encoded in the files within `generator/yml`; new trees, architectures, configs, etc. should be added there. See [the maintainer documentation](docs/maintainer.md) for more information.

### Usage

The tuxsuite and github actions workflow configs should be updated when the files in `generator/yml` change. Ex.

```sh
$ generator/generate.py next
```

The `generator/generate.py` script will run this for you based on the trees that are fed to it. Ex.

```sh
# Generate just next and mainline TuxSuite and GitHub Action workflows
$ generator/generate.py next mainline

# Regenerate all of the current TuxSuite and GitHub Action workflows
$ generator/generate.py
```

The CI the child workflows run can be rerun locally via:

```sh
$ ARCH=arm CONFIG=defconfig LLVM_VERSION=[12|11] [BOOT=0] scripts/check-logs.py
```

where:

  - `ARCH` and `CONFIG` are canonical names from the Linux kernel sources, but should be listed in `generator/yml`'s `architectures` and `configs` files.
  - `LLVM_VERSION` is which version of LLVM to test.
  - `BOOT=0` can be specified to skip the boot test (for instance, when boot failure is expected).

Requires that a [TuxSuite secret token](https://gitlab.com/Linaro/tuxsuite#setup-config) is configured.
