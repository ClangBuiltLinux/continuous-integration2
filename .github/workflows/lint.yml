# Runs several checks
# * check-matrix.py because GitHub limits a workflow matrix to 256 jobs
#   https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/usage-limits-billing-and-administration#usage-limits
# * check-patches.py to make sure applying patches via TuxSuite works correctly
# * shellcheck for shell script correctness
# * shfmt for shell script formatting consistency
# * several linters for Python consistency and correctness
