Subject: Makefile.extrawarn: Move -Wcast-function-type-strict to W=1

We enable -Wcast-function-type globally in the kernel to warn about
mismatching types in function pointer casts. Compilers currently
warn only about ABI incompability with this flag, but Clang 16 will
enable a stricter version of the check by default that checks for an
exact type match. This will be very noisy in the kernel, so disable
-Wcast-function-type-strict without W=1 until the new warnings have
been addressed.
