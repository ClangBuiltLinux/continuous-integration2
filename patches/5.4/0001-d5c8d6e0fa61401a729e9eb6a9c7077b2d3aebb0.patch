Subject: [PATCH 1/5] kbuild: Update assembler calls to use proper flags and
 language target

commit d5c8d6e0fa61401a729e9eb6a9c7077b2d3aebb0 upstream.

as-instr uses KBUILD_AFLAGS, but as-option uses KBUILD_CFLAGS. This can
cause as-option to fail unexpectedly when CONFIG_WERROR is set, because
clang will emit -Werror,-Wunused-command-line-argument for various -m
and -f flags in KBUILD_CFLAGS for assembler sources.

Callers of as-option and as-instr should be adding flags to
KBUILD_AFLAGS / aflags-y, not KBUILD_CFLAGS / cflags-y. Use
KBUILD_AFLAGS in all macros to clear up the initial problem.

Unfortunately, -Wunused-command-line-argument can still be triggered
with clang by the presence of warning flags or macro definitions because
'-x assembler' is used, instead of '-x assembler-with-cpp', which will
consume these flags. Switch to '-x assembler-with-cpp' in places where
'-x assembler' is used, as the compiler is always used as the driver for
out of line assembler sources in the kernel.

Finally, add -Werror to these macros so that they behave consistently
whether or not CONFIG_WERROR is set.

[nathan: Reworded and expanded on problems in commit message
         Use '-x assembler-with-cpp' in a couple more places]
